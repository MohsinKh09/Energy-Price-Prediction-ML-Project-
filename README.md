Project Title: Energy Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Introduction:
The Energy Price Prediction project is a machine learning-based system designed to forecast energy prices by analyzing various features related to energy generation, consumption, and weather forecasts. This project aims to provide valuable insights for energy market participants, grid operators, and consumers, enabling them to make informed decisions in a dynamic energy market.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate energy prices based on historical and real-time data. The project leverages machine learning techniques to predict energy prices, taking into account features such as generation sources (e.g., fossil fuels, renewables), weather forecasts, and historical energy demand.

Key Features and Data Sources:

1. Generation Biomass: Data on energy generation from biomass sources, which include organic materials like wood, agricultural residues, and dedicated energy crops.

2. Generation Fossil Brown Coal/Lignite: Information on energy production from brown coal and lignite, which are fossil fuel sources.

3. Generation Fossil Gas: Data related to energy generation from natural gas, a key fossil fuel source.

4. Generation Fossil Hard Coal: Records of energy generation using hard coal, another type of fossil fuel.

5. Generation Fossil Oil: Information on energy produced from fossil oil sources.

6. Generation Hydro Pumped Storage Consumption: Data regarding energy generation and consumption from hydro pumped storage facilities.

7. Generation Hydro Run-of-River and Poundage: Information on energy generation from run-of-river hydroelectric power plants and water poundage.

8. Generation Hydro Water Reservoir: Data on energy generation from hydroelectric power plants utilizing water reservoirs.

9. Generation Nuclear: Records of energy generated from nuclear power plants.

10. Generation Other: Information on energy generation from sources not covered by the above categories.

11. Generation Other Renewable: Data on energy generation from various renewable sources other than biomass and hydro.

12. Generation Solar: Records of energy generated from solar photovoltaic sources.

13. Generation Waste: Information on energy generation from waste-to-energy processes.

14. Generation Wind Onshore: Data on energy generation from onshore wind turbines.

15. Forecast Solar Day Ahead: Predicted solar energy generation for the following day based on weather forecasts and historical patterns.

16. Forecast Wind Onshore Day Ahead: Predicted onshore wind energy generation for the next day using weather forecasts and historical data.

17. Total Load Forecast: Predictions for the total energy consumption on a future day.

18. Total Load Actual: Actual recorded energy consumption on a given day.

19. Price Day Ahead: The predicted energy prices for the following day.

Machine Learning Models:
The project uses various machine learning algorithms, such as regression models, time series analysis, and deep learning techniques, to predict energy prices. These models are trained on historical data and utilize the provided features to make price predictions.

Benefits:

1. Informed Decision-Making: Energy market participants can use accurate price forecasts to optimize their energy purchasing or selling strategies.

2. Grid Optimization: Grid operators can make more informed decisions about energy generation and distribution.

3. Cost Reduction: Consumers can plan their energy usage to minimize costs during peak price periods.

4. Renewable Integration: Improved forecasting supports the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, as their generation can be variable.

5. Market Transparency: The project enhances market transparency by providing stakeholders with valuable insights into energy price dynamics.

Conclusion:
The Energy Price Prediction project, powered by machine learning and utilizing a wide array of features, offers a valuable tool for energy market participants, grid operators, and consumers. By accurately predicting energy prices, this project facilitates cost savings, improved grid management, and a smoother transition to renewable energy sources.
